A simple mobile web app for cyclists to label ride quality in real time, then view and generate separate good/avoid GPX segments afterwards.

Future updates:

GPX overlap validation: Show a warning if no GPX trackpoints match any recorded segment intervals.
Add segment notes: Allow users to attach notes to segments, with optional voice/microphone input.
Desktop version: Build a desktop-friendly layout with optimized interactions for larger screens.
Strava integration: Enable importing or syncing GPX data with Strava for easier sharing and tracking.
